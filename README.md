# DISPA

was developed in FREMO to assign a vehicle to a LocoNET-throttle independently of a DCC command station. 

<hr>
Version 2.0 (and higher) was developed for the usage on an Arduino-UNO or a compatible board.<br>
In Dispa.ino you can select whether the version should be compiled for an LCD or OLED.<br>
