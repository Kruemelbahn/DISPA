# DISPA

was developed in FREMO to assign a vehicle to a LocoNET-throttle independently of a DCC command station. 

Version 2.0 (and higher) was developed for the usage on an Arduino-UNO or a compatible board.<br>
In Dispa.ino you can select whether the version should be compiled for an LCD or OLED.<br>

The new DISPA needs
- the library [OLEDPanel](https://github.com/Kruemelbahn/OLEDPanel)
